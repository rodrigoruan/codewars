// Same as the previous JS is Weird kata, the theory is:

// You can only use the following characters:

// + ( ) [ ] ! x =

// There are only two tests. Make the function return 'fuelstar' as a string, and don't use any banned characters.

// x= is the initial solution and should be used only to define x. x is preloaded as a variable.

// All other characters (including spaces) are banned.

//  USED JSFUCK TO COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE http://www.jsfuck.com/

x=(![]+[])[+[]]+([][[]]+[])[+[]]+(!![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(!![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+(!![]+[])[+!+[]]
